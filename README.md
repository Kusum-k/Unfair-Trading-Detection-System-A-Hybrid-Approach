# Unfair-Trading-Detection-System-A-Hybrid-Approach
This project focuses on detecting unfair trading practices using a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious trading behaviors that could indicate market manipulation or insider trading.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection:** Imported trading dataset from Kaggle for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Used p-values and confidence intervals to identify significant features and validate hypotheses.
4. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - Applied Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms using RapidMiner for classification.  
   - Leveraged PyCaret's AutoML for automated model training and selection.  
   - Implemented False Discovery Rate (FDR) control to manage multiple hypothesis testing and reduce false positives.
5. **Sentiment Analysis:** Conducted sentiment analysis on related textual data using VADER to incorporate market sentiment insights into the detection system.

## Features

- Robust statistical feature selection and validation.  
- Multiple ML models for improved detection accuracy.  
- Automated model comparison and tuning via PyCaret.  
- Sentiment analysis to capture market sentiment dynamics.  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.  
2. Follow the preprocessing steps in the notebook/script to prepare your dataset.  
3. Run the modeling workflows using RapidMiner or the PyCaret pipeline.  
4. Use the sentiment analysis script to analyze related textual data (e.g., news or social media).  
5. Analyze the results and alerts generated by the system.

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- RapidMiner for ML modeling  
- PyCaret for AutoML  
- VADER for sentiment analysis
